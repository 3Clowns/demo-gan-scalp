# Synthetic Data-Driven Optimization of RL-Based Scalping Trading

This study explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in financial time series. Scalping has the potential for higher profitability due to frequent intraday trades. It fills the gap between traditional day trading and high-frequency trading, which is resource-intensive. The high frequency of transactions in scalping produces more data than traditional day trading that allows us to apply complex deep learning method that can model non-linear temporal dependencies in financial data. GANs can simulate a realistic time series data providing a reliable learning environment for RL strategies. Our core contribution lies in demonstrating that the synergistic integration of RL, scalp trading, and diverse GAN architectures.
